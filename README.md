# NitroOS

It's an entire operating system (kinda) packaged in the form of an application. It is just an application that is programed to run like a operating system. There is no real purpose to this project, but it does (kinda) show how a operating system handles its UI and its core components in a nutshell.

## Features
- Multi User Support (useless? "yes")
- Completely Customizable
- Install Applications

## Dependencies
Required python modules
- pygame
- cryptography

These modules can be installed using pip
- **Windows**: `pip install pygame cryptography`
- **Linux**: Since Linux requires you to install dependicies system-wide, it depends on the distro's package manager used. But here are some common distro commands:
    - Arch: `pacman -S install python-pygame python-cryptography`

For more information, see the Install.md file.


## Installation
After installing the required dependencies, you can clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/Nitrostation-Dev/NitroOS.git`

`cd NitroOS`

Now you can run the application using this command:

`python main.py`
(or)
`python3 main.py` (if you are in linux)
